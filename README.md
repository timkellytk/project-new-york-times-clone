# HTML and CSS Clone - New York Times Article

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements)

The project is a clone of a [New York Time's article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0) using HTML and CSS. The CSS is written in BEM with PascalCasing, as recommended in the [Airbnb CSS style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css).

The website uses CSS grid, flexbox, Google Fonts and iframes. The article navigation is revealed and hidden on scroll using 18 lines of JavaScript. The project was designed for desktop devices. For mobile responsive designs, review [Youtube clone](https://github.com/timkellytk/project-youtube-clone) or [Mailchimp clone](https://github.com/timkellytk/project-mailchimp-clone).
